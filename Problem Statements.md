## Instructions
- You are supposed to have at least one person per team

1

> A homeowner reports that their security alarm is "possessed." It beeps when no one is there, and when someone actually walks by, it stays silent. It’s behaving like a confused ghost. The security system is unstable and hallucinating. Stabilize the input signal and fix the brain logic so the alarm only sounds when the PIR slider detects movement

>You have been commissioned by SecureHome Inc. to deploy a prototype motion-sensing security illumination system. The system architecture mandates a specific logic flow: upon detection of an intruder by the PIR Motion Sensor, the Relay must actuate, thereby energizing the High-Voltage Bulb. Conversely, in the absence of detected motion, the bulb must remain in a deactivated state to optimize energy efficiency.
>
>However, a critical error was introduced during the initial wiring implementation. Currently, the illumination unit remains in a perpetually active state (ON) by default and fails to disengage, resulting in unnecessary power dissipation and compromising the system's utility as a deterrent.

>The Royal Bank of Bitland protects its gold reserves using a high-security Dual-Key Mechanism. The vault is guarded by two senior officers, Officer A and Officer B.
>
>The vault door (represented by a Green LED) is designed to open if and only if BOTH Officer A and Officer B insert and turn their electronic keys (represented by Switch A and Switch B) simultaneously.
>
>However, a rogue technician has sabotaged the wiring! Currently, the system is malfunctioning—the vault either refuses to open, or worse, opens when only one officer is present. The bank manager is panicking.
>
>As an elite troubleshooter for the "Circuit Medic" squad, your task is to debug the physical circuit. You must identify the wiring faults, fix the connections, and restore the correct gate logic to the security system.

>A high-end gaming PC is crashing! The patient is burning up! The fan's survival instinct is inverted. You must re-calibrate the mapping logic so that higher heat equals higher RPM, and check the 'veins' (wiring) of the transistor to ensure the fan gets full power. Can you save the CPU?

> "A localized radiation leak in Sector 7 has caused a catastrophic failure. While the leak was temporarily plugged with lead shielding, the damage is done: the **Main Cooling Turbine** control system has been corrupted.
> 
> During inspection, we found the turbine (DC Motor) is unresponsive—it only emits a faint, high-pitched whine. The **Manual Override Dial** (Potentiometer) is behaving erratically; as you turn it, the turbine speed seems to 'reset' and jump wildly rather than speeding up smoothly. Even the **System Ready LED** is dark, despite the control board receiving power.
> 
> **The Problem:** The radiation didn't just scramble the code; it physically degraded the connections. The code is 'hallucinating'—sending values it shouldn't to pins that can't handle them.
> 
> **Your Mission:** You have 15 minutes. Use your LLM consultant to patch the code, but remember: the LLM can't see the 'physical' damage hidden under the lead shielding. You must describe the wiring and the symptoms to find the hardware fractures and restore the cooling flow before the core temperature exceeds safety limits."
## Twist:
Every 15 Mins one of you medics dies (you have to leave the room when you die)
### Instructions:
- you are allowed to use LLMs under the supervision of volunteers
- you are not supposed to take screenshots of your Tinkercad window 
- you can only explain your current state of the circuit to the LLM
- you are allowed ask volunteers to use google on volunteers phones for the components
